# merge-list

## About
I made this because I needed this when dealing with the removal of some Xorg packages through pacman (I use arch BTW). At that time, I didn't (try) find a decent tool to filter and merge these package lists so I made my own. This piece of software at this state satisfies my original intention. But since I'm a greedy boy, I may (or may not) add more features (and bugs).

## Installation
- Clone this repo
- Compile
- Add to path
- Boom

## Future
- I don't honestly know
